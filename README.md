## Introduction

The Distributed Consensus of Synchronised Time (DCST) project implements a novel approach to decentralized time synchronization. It addresses the critical challenge of maintaining accurate and trustworthy time across a distributed network without relying on a central authority, while allowing for dynamic participation of nodes.

### Why DCST?

In distributed systems, accurate time synchronization is crucial for:
- Ensuring the correct order of events
- Coordinating distributed transactions
- Maintaining data consistency
- Enabling precise logging and auditing

Traditional time synchronization methods often rely on centralized time servers or complex consensus mechanisms. DCST introduces a paradigm shift in how we approach distributed time synchronization.

### Key Features

- GPS-based time correction at intervals
- Innovative consensus mechanism where each node is a potential source of truth
- Tolerance for node dynamism (frequent joining and leaving)
- Cryptographic proofs for time claims verification
- Data Availability (DA) layer for proof submission
- Efficient validation of node actions based on time accuracy

## Key Concepts

### 1. Intermittent GPS Synchronization

DCST uses GPS time only at intervals to correct the internal clock of each client. This approach reduces reliance on constant GPS availability while maintaining accuracy.

### 2. Accepted Range of Variance

As long as a node's internal clock is running within an accepted range of variance, all its actions are considered valid. This allows for efficient operation between GPS synchronizations.

### 3. Flipped Consensus Model

In DCST, there is no single source of truth. Instead, every participant is a potential source of truth for the single variable of time. The network uses consensus to validate these individual truths, rather than to establish a single agreed-upon time.

### 4. Action Validity

Consensus in DCST serves to ensure that all nodes are within the accepted time range. Actions from nodes with time outside this range are invalidated until the node produces a proof of being back in range.

### 5. Proof Submission to DA Layer

Nodes don't exchange proofs directly. Instead, they submit proofs to a Data Availability (DA) layer, reducing network traffic and enhancing scalability.

## System Architecture

DCST employs a modular architecture designed for flexibility and resilience in dynamic network conditions.

```

This architecture ensures:
1. Accurate time synchronization through periodic GPS updates
2. Stability between synchronizations via high-precision oscillators
3. Security through cryptographic proofs and secure elements
4. Scalability through the use of a DA layer
5. Resilience through the innovative consensus approach

## Technical Implementation

### Time Representation

DCST uses a multi-faceted approach to time representation:

1. GPS Time: Seconds since GPS epoch
2. Internal Time: High-resolution timestamp maintained by the oscillator
3. Proof Time: Time included in the cryptographic proof

### Kalman Filter for Time Estimation

The Timekeeping Unit employs a Kalman filter to optimally estimate the current time based on GPS measurements and the local oscillator:

```python
class TimekeepingUnit:
    def __init__(self, gps_module, oscillator):
        # ... initialization ...
        self.state = np.array([0.0, 0.0])  # [time_offset, frequency_offset]
        self.P = np.eye(2) * 1e-8  # Initial state covariance
        self.Q = np.array([[1e-12, 0], [0, 1e-16]])  # Process noise covariance
        self.R = 1e-9  # Measurement noise covariance

    async def synchronize(self):
        gps_time = await self.gps_module.get_time_data()
        local_time = self.oscillator.get_time()
        
        # Kalman filter update
        z = gps_time - local_time
        H = np.array([1, 0])
        y = z - np.dot(H, self.state)
        S = np.dot(np.dot(H, self.P), H.T) + self.R
        K = np.dot(np.dot(self.P, H.T), np.linalg.inv(S))
        self.state += np.dot(K, y)
        self.P = np.dot((np.eye(2) - np.dot(K, H)), self.P)

        self.oscillator.set_offset(self.state[0])
```

This approach allows the system to maintain high accuracy over time while reducing the frequency of GPS synchronizations.

### Cryptographic Proof Generation

The Proof Generation Unit creates verifiable time claims:

```python
class ProofGenerationUnit:
    def generate_proof(self) -> TimeProof:
        current_time = int(self.timekeeping_unit.get_time() * 1e9)
        
        data_to_sign = current_time.to_bytes(8, 'big') + self.last_proof_hash
        nonce = self.secure_element.generate_nonce()
        signature = self.secure_element.sign(data_to_sign + nonce)

        return TimeProof(
            node_id=self.secure_element.node_id,
            timestamp=current_time,
            previous_proof_hash=self.last_proof_hash,
            nonce=nonce,
            signature=signature
        )
```

This approach ensures that time claims are cryptographically verifiable while maintaining efficiency in proof size and verification time.

## Consensus Mechanism

DCST implements a novel consensus mechanism that flips traditional approaches on their head:

1. Each node is a potential source of truth for time.
2. Nodes submit time proofs to the DA layer at regular intervals.
3. The Validation Engine checks these proofs to ensure nodes are within the accepted time range.
4. Actions from nodes within the range are considered valid.
5. Actions from nodes outside the range are invalidated until a new, in-range proof is submitted.

This approach allows for:
- Efficient operation in dynamic networks where nodes frequently join and leave
- Reduced network overhead as nodes don't need to constantly agree on a single time
- Quick identification and isolation of nodes with inaccurate time

## Security Measures

DCST implements several security measures:

1. **GPS Anti-Spoofing**: Basic checks for realistic time progression and signal characteristics.
2. **Secure Element Simulation**: Simulates a hardware secure element for key storage and cryptographic operations.
3. **Cryptographic Proofs**: Uses Schnorr signatures for verifiable time claims.
4. **Action Validation**: Ensures only actions from nodes with accurate time are accepted.
5. **Data Availability Layer**: Provides a secure and accessible storage for time proofs.

## Running a Node

To run a DCST node:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy cryptography aiohttp
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```

   ```

Specify the DA layer URL to connect to the network.
